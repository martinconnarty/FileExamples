Disk Image File - IMG

# Extension

IMG

## Description

**From Wikipedia** - An IMG file is a disk image file that stores an exact copy of a CD, DVD, or floppy disk. It is used for backup purposes, allowing you to access the contents of the disk without the need for the physical medium. IMG files can be used to store various types of media, including operating systems, games, apps, and movies.


**Security Concerns***

IMG Files, like ISO files are sometimes emailed/linked to in Phishing emails as they can hide malicious payloads like scripts/exes etc. When a victim clicks it, Windows will by default mount it as if it's a new drive and then show the files within as if it's just a folder.
