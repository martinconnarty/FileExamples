# File Examples

I have worked in the Cybersecurity industry for some time, and often I find myself asking "What would this file look like in my logs if I downloaded/emailed/executed it?"

This Repo of file types that I intend to add to should address that, giving me useful information such as:


1. An example file (so often difficult to find)
2. Mime Types where applicable
3. Header Signatures (Magic Bytes) where applicable
4. Security Concerns and examples

For the example files, I will try and create these myself, typically they will contain a minimal amount of data, such as "test".
