7z is a compressed archive file format that supports several different data compression, encryption and pre-processing algorithms. The 7z format initially appeared as implemented by the 7-Zip archiver. 

**Security Concerns**

The 7z application has like other archive files been used in Phishing campaigns, however that does require the victim to have something capable of opening the files.

Like some of the other archive formats, it has been used by threat actors to archive and compress data ready for exfiltration.
