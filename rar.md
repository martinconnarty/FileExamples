## Description

**From Wikipedia**

RAR is a proprietary archive file format that supports data compression, error correction and file spanning.[3] It was developed in 1993 by Russian software engineer Eugene Roshal.

**Security Concerns**

The RAR application has like other archive files been used in Phishing campaigns, however that does require the victim to have something capable of opening the files.

Like some of the other archive formats, it has been used by threat actors to archive and compress data ready for exfiltration.
