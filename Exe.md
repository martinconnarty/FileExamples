## Description

**From Wikipedia**

For Microsoft Windows, OS/2, and DOS, .exe is the filename extension that denotes a file as being executable.

**Security Concerns**

Exe Files are the standard for executable files within Windows, and as such a majority of attacks on Windows Endpoints are likely to involve these in some way. As such, controlling the delivery mechanisms and execution of these should be a priority.
